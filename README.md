# Time-series-forecasting
This repository contains codes for Multivariate and Univariate Time-series forecasting using the Keras: python's Deeplearning Library
There are two codes in this repository:
1. lstmty2.py: LSTM based forecasting of realtime traffic occupancy data form Traffic department of the Minnesota, USA. The aim here is to predict 500 observarions using first 2000 observation. the .csv  file corresponding to the data is provided in the repository. The univariate data can be easily downloaded from the site, https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab. It contains a folder by the name 'nab'. the .csv file is 'occupancy_t4013.csv'. which is located in the 'realTraffic' sdubfolder of the parent folder 'nab'.
2. lstmty3.py: LSTM based Mutivariable time-series forecasting of Household power consumption data. the data can be downloaded from, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption. The aim here is to predict the Global_active_power using other 6 predictors.
